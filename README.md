### MATLAB Code
See .m file in the repository for calculation. Test file is provided (.mat) for algorithm testing.


### Test files
One test file (.mat) is provided for testing. Sampling rate 500 Hz. Amplitude resolution 1 ÂµV.

### STATA code for statistical analysis
See STATA .do file. We used the kappa-statistic measure of interrater agreement for two independent raters. Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with a rating and discrete classification data was performed to calculate the area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) and measure the automated pacing artifact detection's sensitivity and specificity.
